Local Lakehouse architecture for processing and analyzing employee data. The purpose of this project is to improve my data engineering skills and get hands-on with specific tech and the lakehouse architecture.

This project is based on the repository from this article by Vu Trinh: https://blog.dataengineerthings.org/build-a-lakehouse-on-a-laptop-with-dbt-airflow-trino-iceberg-and-minio-0700540a183d
